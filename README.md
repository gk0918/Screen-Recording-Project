This project is a Python-based screen recording tool designed to capture your screen in real-time and save the output as a video file. 
It is ideal for creating tutorials, gameplay recordings, and other screen activities. Key features include customizable screen resolution, 
AVI output format using the XVID codec, and a live preview window that displays the recording in real-time. 
Additionally, it offers a debug mode for monitoring screenshot activities.

To use the tool, you need to install the required Python packages: PyAutoGUI, OpenCV (cv2), and NumPy. 
Once set up, you can adjust parameters like video resolution and codec, create a VideoWriter object to handle video output, and start recording by executing the main script. 
Recording can be stopped at any time by pressing the 'q' key.

Contributions are encouraged, and the project is licensed under the MIT License. Enjoy creating your screen recordings! ðŸŽ¥
